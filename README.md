## Project description

This is a test task. The task description can be found at this [link](https://www.figma.com/file/n4G119zrMTIJhrY5Nlub8v/UI-Test-Task?node-id=0%3A1&t=2Gx8R7py01pXLUgq-1).

I consider the current task as a project. Any project, whether it's long-term or short-term, has a basic minimum of features that need to be implemented and more extensive functionality. A week is allocated for the completion of this task. However, it's also necessary to take into account the free time that the developer is willing to invest in the development.

Considering the above, I decompose the task into small subtasks.

## History

### Jun 05, 2024

First and foremost, I want to focus on preparing the environment and creating the markup. As a result, I need to get a ready-made set of components and a general layout. Visually, all components should be in their places.

Visually, the following elements can be identified:

- Button
- Checkbox
- Selected item component
- Search
- Dropdown list with filters
- Modal window
